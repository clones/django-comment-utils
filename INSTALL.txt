Installation instructions
=========================

There are two ways to install this application for use by your
projects; the easiest in most cases is to do a Subversion checkout
into a directory that's on your Python path::

    svn co http://django-comment-utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/comment_utils/

The other method is to download a packaged version and use Python's
``distutils`` to install it onto your Python path::

    wget http://django-comment-utils.googlecode.com/files/comment_utils-0.1.tar.gz
    tar zxvf comment_utils-0.1.tar.gz
    cd comment_utils-0.1
    python setup.py install

Depending on your system configuration, you may need to prefix the
last command with ``sudo`` and supply your password to perform a
system-wide installation.
